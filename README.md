When you first add the Vault Chat plugin, it will need to index your existing vault files for ChatGPT to use during your conversations. This can take time (approx 1 minute per 100 files). You can use Vault Chat during this time, but until indexing is complete your assistant will not have full context for your conversation.

When you are ready, use the command palette to start your conversation with the command: `Vault Chat: ask ChatGPT`
